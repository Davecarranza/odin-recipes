            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>50 gm provolone cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 Cook the pork and mutton meat In a skillet, cook mutton and sausage over medium heat until they are soft and tender. You must keep the flame low and the pan covered so that the meats are properly cooked. You may need to add small quantities of water if you find the meats to be too dry during the process.</li>
        <li>Step 2 Prepare the meat sauce Add tomato sauce, tomato puree, garlic cloves, sugar, salt, pepper, oregano in the skillet. Simmer the ingredients, uncovered, for about an hour, stirring occasionally. Keep the flame low or the liquids will all dry up. Your meat sauce is ready!</li>
        <li>Step 3 Mix all the cheese with eggs In a bowl, combine the eggs, parsley, cottage cheese, ricotta and parmesan cheese. Spread 1 cup of meat sauce in an ungreased baking dish. You do not need to grease it as the sauce has enough fat.</li>
        <li>Step 4 Make the layering using cheese, lasagne sheet and meat sauce Layer with lasagne sheet, provolone cheese, 2 cups of cottage cheese mixture, 1 cup of mozzarella, lasagne sheet, 2 cups of meat sauce, remaining cottage cheese mixture and 1 cup of mozzarella. Top with remaining sheets, meat sauce and mozzarella (dish will be full).</li>
        <li>Step 5 Bake the lasagna for 50 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit Cover and bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for around 50 minutes. Then uncover and bake for 20 minutes more. Let it stand for 15 minutes before cutting or it will disintegrate. Once it cools down, cut into squares and serve hot.</li>
